2. E-commerce Product Catalog System

Objective: The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate a deep understanding of inheritance and method overriding in Python. 
Students will apply these concepts to develop an E-commerce Product Catalog System that handles various types of products with 
both common and unique attributes.

Problem Statement: An e-commerce platform requires a system to manage different types of products, such as books, 
electronics, and clothing. Each product type shares some common characteristics but also has unique features. 
The system should be able to display information about each product appropriately.

Task 1: Create Base Product Class

Develop a base class Product with common attributes like product ID, name, price, and a method to display product information.
Expected Outcome: A Product class that can hold general information about a product and display it.

Task 2: Implement Subclasses for Specific Products

Create subclasses Book, Electronic, and Clothing that inherit from Product.
Each subclass should have additional attributes relevant to its category (e.g., author for books, specs for electronics, size for clothing).
Expected Outcome: Each subclass contains both inherited attributes from Product and new attributes specific to the product type.

Task 3: Override Display Method in Subclasses

Override the method to display product information in each subclass to include specific attributes.
For example, the Book class should display the author, Electronic should display specs, etc.
Expected Outcome: Calling the display method on an instance of any subclass shows both common and specific product details.

Task 4: Test Product Catalog Functionality

Instantiate objects of each subclass and call their display methods to ensure correct information is shown.
Expected Outcome: The system should accurately display detailed information for each type of product, demonstrating 
inheritance and method overriding.
Code Examples:

class Product:
    # Constructor and common attributes
    # ...

    def display_info(self):
        # General method to display product info
        # ...

class Book(Product):
    def __init__(self, product_id, name, price, author):
        super().__init__(product_id, name, price)
        self.author = author

    def display_info(self):
        # Overridden method for books
        # ...

# Example usage
my_book = Book("123", "Python Essentials", 29.99, "J. Doe")
my_book.display_info()

from Catalog import Product as p


def add_product():
  product_id = input("Enter the product ID number: ")
  product_name = input("Enter the name of product: ")
  product_price = float(input("Enter the price of the product: "))
  product = p(product_id,product_name,product_price)
